I am a Ph.D. student at the [IRISA](https://www.irisa.fr/) research center at the [University of Rennes](https://www.univ-rennes.fr/), France. My research is conducted under the supervision of Prof. David Bromberg (University of Rennes) and Prof. Marc Dacier (KAUST). I am part of the [Wide](https://team.inria.fr/wide/) research team.

My Research is focusing on cheating detection in multiplayer online games, with an emphasis on network-level attacks, such as Lag Switch and DDoS, that disrupt the syncrhonization mechanisms implemented within game engines. 

Before that, I was a visiting student within the [Serber](https://serber.kaust.edu.sa/) research group at KAUST, Saudi Arabia.
